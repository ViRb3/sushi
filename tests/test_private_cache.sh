# without its own cache root would read, write and sweep the real ~/.sushi/kv-cache.
#   [1] tests/private_cache.sh gives a script a private root under HOME, wipes only a root it made,
#       and leaves a caller-set root (and a sentinel beside it) untouched
#   [2] every tests/*.sh that names a sushi binary sources it or sets SUSHI_PREFIX_CACHE_DIR itself
# Hermetic, no model, no GPU.
